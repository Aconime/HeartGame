# HEART GAME POINTS



# Ranks & Experience

### About Ranks & Experience

The Game has a fully functional ranking system, which will allow the user to advance to new levels. This system is based on experience points, which you can gain by winning games or lose by losing games accordingly.

Each game will have a fixed amount of experience points to offer depending on the rank a player has. Once a player selects an answer the game will calculate the `XP` and the player will receive the corresponding amount.

The higher the rank, the more you lose if you fail to answer correctly.
